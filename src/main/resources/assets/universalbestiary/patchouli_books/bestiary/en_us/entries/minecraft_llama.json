It spits at anything that attacks it, as well as at nearby $(l:minecraft_wolf)$(mob)Wolves$(), making them flee. It can be tamed by riding it until it stops kicking the rider. After that, it can be given a $(item)Chest$() to transport items, $(item)Carpet$() to make it prettier and $(item)Hay Bale$() to breed it. Tamed $(mob)Llamas$() can be led with a $(item)Leash$(), causing other tamed $(mob)Llamas$() to follow."
