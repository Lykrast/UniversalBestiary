They attack players on sight by approaching them and striking them once in melee, disappearing immediately afterwards. Although a $(mob)Spectre's$() melee attack deals no damage it bestows a curse on one enchantable item carried by the target, including items worn. Wearing a $(item)Witch Hat$() prevents these curses from being bestowed."
